# Discrete-Math-Final-project
# Card Outcome Probability Calculator
## Overview
The **Card Outcome Probability Calculator** is a menu-based C++ program developed to calculate probabilities related to drawing cards from a standard 52-card deck.  
It applies concepts of **Discrete Mathematics**, including probability, counting principles, combinations, and Monte Carlo simulation.
## Project Track
**Track 6: Counting & Combinatorics**
## Features
### One-Card Probability
- Probability of drawing a face card
- Probability of a specific face card (Jack, Queen, King)  
- Probability of a number card (2–10)  
- Probability of a specific number card  
- Probability of drawing an Ace  
- Probability of drawing a specific card  
- Probability of a specific suit  
- Probability of NOT drawing an Ace  
### Two-Card Probability
- Probability of two cards having the same rank  
- Probability of drawing one Ace and one non-Ace  
- Probability of drawing two cards of the same color
